//2. we will now create a method IncrementQuality(int i) 
// and extract the piece of code that is incrementing the quality of 
// various items at several places to reduce the bad smells in our code. 
// there is a complication in it, this piece of code contains a condition which is hard to modify that is
// Quality < 50 on the outrr side to solve this we are creating this method and writing this condition inside the method
// so by doing this technique there will be no effect on the code

// 4.At the end iâ€™ll make a method call UpdateQualityForExpiredItems this method will

// hard to understand into a single method UpdateQualityForExpiredItems
